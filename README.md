### Hangman Game Instructions

**Objective:**  
Guess the secret word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. 

### How to Play:

- When you run the game, a random word will be chosen from a predefined list. The number of letters in the word will be displayed as underscores (`_`);
- Enter a single letter in the input box provided;
- Click the "Guess" button to submit your guess;
- You can only guess one letter at a time. Make sure it's a single alphabetical character;
- If you guess a letter that youâ€™ve already guessed, a message will inform you that you have already made that guess;

4. **Game Feedback:**
   - If the guessed letter is in the word, it will replace the corresponding underscores with the letter.
   - If the guessed letter is not in the word, your attempt count will decrease by one.

5. **Attempts Left:**  
   The game will display how many attempts you have left. You start with a set number of attempts (usually 6). 

6. **Winning the Game:**  
   - You win if you guess all the letters in the word before running out of attempts.
   - A congratulatory message will appear when you successfully guess the word.

7. **Losing the Game:**  
   - If you run out of attempts before guessing the word, a message will inform you that you lost, and it will reveal the correct word.

8. **Exiting the Game:**  
   Once the game is over (either win or lose), you can close the window to exit.

### Tips for Success:
- Try to guess vowels first (like A, E, I, O, U) as they are common in many words.
- Pay attention to the letters you've already guessed to avoid repeating them.
- Think about common prefixes or suffixes in words to help narrow down your guesses.

Enjoy playing Hangman! If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.
